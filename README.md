# Obsidian Shortcut Launcher

Trigger shortcuts in Apple's Shortcuts app as custom commands from Obsidian. 

Obsidian Shortcut Launcher (abbreviated as 'OSL') lets you trigger shortcuts and pass along values from Obsidian as input. On macOS Monterey, shortcuts are triggered by Obsidian in the background, without launching the Shortcuts app; on iOS and iPadOS 15, OSL launches shortcuts via URL scheme.

The plugin requires iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey.

## Creating Launchers for Shortcuts

You can create a new launcher for Shortcuts in Shortcut Launcher's settings by tapping the 'New' button. When creating a new launcher, there are three main fields you have to configure:

* **Command Name**: The name of the launcher. This will appear as a command in Obsidian. This name can be anything you want and does not need to match the name of the shortcut.
* **Shortcut Name**: The exact name of the shortcut you want to launch in Shortcuts app.
* **Input Type**: The input you want to pass from Obsidian to the Shortcuts app. See next section for more details.

## Passing Values from Obsidian

There are seven different input types you can pass from Obsidian to Shortcuts:

* **Selected Text**:
* **Selected Link/Embed Contents**:
* **Current Paragraph**:
* **Entire Document**:
* **Link to Document**:
* **Document Name**:
* **Document Path**:
